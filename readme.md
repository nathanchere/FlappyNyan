Flappy Nyan
===========

I wanted to make a Nyan Cat themed variant of the overnight sensation Flappy Bird just for the hell of it.

It's such a trivial game that the Google Play and iTunes app stores are already full of half-baked clones by unimaginative developers. While I'm happy to share my code for others to learn from, I have no desire to assist said parasites in further flooding the app stores by providing a template they can make minimal changes to (usually adding ads and in-app purchases) then submit as their own work. Since it's one of the last remaining 'pure' gaming platforms I decided it would be a good opportunity to learn how to develop for the Nintendo DS.

Credits and thanks
------------------

* Nguyễn Hà Đông - the original Flappy Birds game
* DevKitPro - making cross-compiling for NDS a breeze
* no$gba - ultrea-light-weight emulator for shorter test cycles
